"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely". Once, i was seven years old. It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger. Pushing: each other to the limits, we were learning quicker. By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor.
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure.
